# 30up-letter-to-barcodes
Converts an 8.5" x 11" 30-up label sheet into images of the individual 2.625" x 1" barcodes. Intended to be used to convert these sheets for printing on a label printer on barcode-sized paper.

This script converts 30-up labels (1" x 2-5/8" on US Letter paper) of the format found on sellercentral.amazon.com into individual barcode images for printing on barcode-size paper on a label printer. You could either print the converted folder of barcode images, or code another routine to convert a folder of .pngs into a .pdf and print that.

This also bolds the ASIN and item description slightly, while leaving the barcode untouched.
